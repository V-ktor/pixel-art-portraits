## About

Pixel art slightly anime style portrait generator for Godot Engine. Compatible with Godot 3.3.x. It's meant to be opened or run using Godot's project manager. See https://godotengine.org/

For HTML5 file export a plugin is used: https://github.com/Pukkah/HTML5-File-Exchange-for-Godot

## Main scenes
### /scenes/female.tscn:
The actual portrait (for female characters). Separate components can be chosen via drop down menus (using tool scripts to update the sprites). Colouring is done with shaders.
### /scenes/gui.tscn:
A more user friendly GUI that can be used to create portraits (manually or randomly generated) and to save them as png files.
